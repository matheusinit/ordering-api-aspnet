# Ordering API ASP.NET

This project is a practice to learn more about ASP.NET Core and C#.

I'm using the MVC pattern and Test Driven Development (TDD) for this project. TDD is a way to develop software by writing tests first.
I'm confortable enough with TDD, but MVC is new to me. I thought i knew it, but I didn't.
