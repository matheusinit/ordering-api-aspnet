# Ordering API ASP.NET

This project is a practice to learn more about ASP.NET Core and C#.

I'm using the MVC pattern and Test Driven Development (TDD) for this project. TDD is a way to develop software by writing tests first.
I'm confortable enough with TDD, but MVC is new to me. I thought i knew it, but I didn't.

### Why use Decimal instead of Double type?

The `double` type is not as precise as `decimal`. Due to this, `decimal` is recommended for when number precision is needed, for example currency, one of the domain object used in this project.
